	opinion mining to analyze content on the Web, challenges arise that
	usually do not occur in laboratory environments where prepared and

	in real world situations. After outlining the identified shortcomings
	and presenting a general process model for opinion mining, promising
	solutions for language identification, content extraction and dealing
